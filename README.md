# Terraform: Up & Running Code

This repo contains the code samples from my personal reading of the book *[Terraform: Up and Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)*, 3rd Edition by [Yevgeniy Brikman](http://www.ybrikman.com).



## Looking for the Original Sample code for the 3rd edition?

*Terraform: Up & Running* now on its **3rd edition**. If you're looking for the original code examples for the 3rd editions by the Author, please see the following branch:

* [Terraform: Up and Running 3rd-edition branch](https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code/tree/3rd-edition).



## Quick start

All code is grouped by chapters. The code examples are organized first by chapters and then tool or language and then
[code](/code) folder, and listing-xx(xx being the listing number). For example, if you're looking at an example of Terraform code in Chapter 2, you'll find it in the [ch2/terraform/code/listing-02](ch2/terraform/code/listing-02) folder; if you're looking at an OPA (Rego) example in Chapter 9, you'll find it in the [ch9/terraform-testing/code/listing-03/](ch9/terraform-testing/code/listing-03) folder.

For instructions on running the code, please consult the README in each folder, and, of course, the
*[Terraform: Up and Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)* book.
